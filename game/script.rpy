  lt "Curious. So his customer bet on a certain horse, and lost so badly they went into debt."

  lt "I wonder if this has something to do with all the incidents at the Razing Thunder..."

  lt "Last night, we came across the person I was looking for shortly after. The guy hadn't run too far away, and it looked like the color drained from his face the moment I brought up the debt collector looking for him."

  lt "Getting him to spill the beans wasn't easy, but his reactions when Castillo's name was brought up said it all."

  lt "Of course, he didn't know who was behind the string of incidents, but he confirmed that debt collectors had been pressuring him ever since the day he bet on Perla Negra and lost."

  lt "There's been more and more victims like him going through the same situation ever since this turf race event started a while ago."

  lt "They'll bet a considerable amount of cash on a promising jockey, only for their pick to mysteriously lose at the last second."

  lt "Since the race itself is a private competition hosted by some bigshot businessman, it makes it difficult for the authorities to get involved."

  lt "On the surface, these are nothing more than a string of unfortunate accidents, after all. Ones that just happen to fill up the pockets of those handling the race bets. The clandestine type, that is."
  
  lt "Limited involvement from the cops gives them more leeway to get away with it. As if regular gambling wasn't enough of a problem, this crap happens…"

  lt "People bet on a horse that ends up losing, which in turn means they're neck deep into debt. And those that can't pay back are visited by guys like the one I came across."

  lt "A tale as old as time. Even so, I can't just stand by and watch it happen. Especially with the kind of foul play going on at the turf race."

  lt "The testimonies I have gathered and the aprietadoresI've fought off all point to the Castillo family being involved somehow."

  lt "They're putting up a front, operating as another sponsor for the Razing Thunder competitors."

  lt "Naturally, just losing a bet doesn't equate to being drowned in debt. I suspect these fiends knowingly allow people to gamble money they don't have, then send their underlings after them when they can't pay. What a wicked scheme."

  lt "I can't help but think that they'd make even bigger bucks if someone knew which horse would drop out next during the races..."

  lt "At any rate, while not unheard of, it's plain unnatural that it has happened three times in a row. Trainers and jockeys are not that neglectful with the horses' health."

  lt "...at least, I hope they aren't."

  lt "Either way, it's clear there is more than meets the eye! That's why today, I am going to talk to other victims of their ploys and gather clues to bring those fiends to justice—"

  lt "Tapping on the notification while letting out a deep sigh, I read what the boss sent me. "
